# CryptoN
A simple class that makes it easier to do few basic crypto tasks.

At this stage, its quite basic, and its hardcoded to use Rijndael as a symmetric algorithm.

Functionality so far:

- Encrypting/Decrypting byte arrays.
- Encrypting/Decrypting strings.
- Encrypting/Decrypting files.
- Encrypting/Decrypting streams.
- Random Key and IV generation
- Extension methods to convert back and to Base64 and Hex Encoded strings

Plans for future expansion are underway.
